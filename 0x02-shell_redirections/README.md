# Shell Redirection
Shell redirection is a powerful feature in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
It allows you to control input and output streams of commands and programs, enabling you to manipulate data flow easily. Redirection is commonly used to redirect input from files, redirect output to files, and combine multiple commands' inputs and outputs.
